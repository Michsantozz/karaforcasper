 * Liveness + readiness in a single endpoint.
 *
 * - Liveness: if this handler responds, the Node process is alive.
 * - Readiness: `?ready=1` (or `?deep=1`) also pings Postgres with `SELECT 1`.
 *   Without the dependency up, returns 503 → orchestrator won't route traffic to the pod.
 *
 * Probe liveness with `GET /api/health` (fast, no external I/O) and readiness
 * with `GET /api/health?ready=1`. Separating them avoids a slow DB taking down
 * the pod via a liveness failure (restart loop) when it's only temporarily not-ready.
