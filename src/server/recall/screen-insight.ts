/**
 * Screen INTELLIGENCE — the vision layer. Reads the content of shared-screen
 * frames that the transcript is blind to: the number on a chart, the slide's
 * target, the error on screen, the diagram. Each frame (already uploaded to
 * object storage, passed here as a URL) is sent to the vision model with a short
 * transcript excerpt around its moment, and the model extracts what's literally
 * on screen — never invented.
 *
 * One vision call PER frame (isolates a bad frame instead of failing the batch),
 * best-effort: a frame that fails to read is dropped, never throws. Runs on the
 * vision-capable Fireworks model via createChatModel(). The frame URL and the
 * transcript excerpt are treated strictly as DATA (prompt-injection guard).
